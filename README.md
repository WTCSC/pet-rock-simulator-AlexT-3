#### Alexandria Tuell

>This program is a virtual pet game where the player has to keep a pet rock alive for as long as possible. After each round, the player is presented with choices on how to take care of their rock. Each descision affects the rocks stats differently. Some actions imrpove certain attributes, while other actions decrease them. The challenge is to balance the rocks health and to see how long you can help it survive.

#### Startup and gameplay: 
Within the terminal, type in the command `python3 rock.py`

You will first be prompted to name your pet rock. After that, the game will display your rock’s starting stats, and you’ll choose how to take care of it each round.
```
---Your pet rock, Rocky---
Fullness: 5/10

```
The game will continue until at least one of the rock's stats is depleated to zero.
